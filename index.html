        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            While I was a kid, I have always been fascinated about how things work and I tried to figure them out. It was the spark that led to increase my interest in technology and science so I decided to connect my future career with them. Now that I just turned 19 years old and still have the exact same passion for technology and computers and after seeing the great opportunity in taking a step forward to a brighter future, I could not have been more excited.<br>I want to learn programming and especially web-development because more and more services and products are moving to a web-based system and it is a good opportunity to get into development. Moreover, I am planning to study IT after I finish my high school (finished 9th and 10th grade in Denmark) and this will be a great starting point in IT.
